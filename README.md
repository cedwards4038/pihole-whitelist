# pihole-whitelist
This was a quick project to whitelist commonly whitelisted domains. I am using adguard, so it was harder to use the documentation I used with pihole from [here]([url](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/commonly-whitelisted-domains/212)https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/commonly-whitelisted-domains/212)

The raw whitelist is here
